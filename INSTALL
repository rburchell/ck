Installation instructions for the ContextKit
--------------------------------------------

A ContextKit release can usually be compiled with the following
popular recipe:

    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ make install

If you want to modify the sources or if you have checked out the
sources from a development branch, please read the following little
survival guide:

In general, recompiling ContextKit after touching a source file might
require some tools that are not needed when just compiling a freshly
unpacked release.  Those tools might or might not be available (yet)
in your distribution of choice.

Specifically, many tools are not available in Maemo.  Thus, the
recommended way to work on the sources is to hack outside of Maemo,
make a release there, and compile that release inside Maemo.

The following procedure should work quite nicely.

Bootstrap the buildsystem after checking out a source tree from Git.
Do this outside of Maemo, in Debian or Ubuntu.

   $ ./autogen.sh

This will check for all the maintainer tools that are needed.  Install
them until ./autogen.sh is happy.

   $ ./configure --emable-gtk-doc
   $ make
   $ make dist

These steps build the source tree and get it into a shape where a
release can be made.

Now switch to Maemo and chdir back into the same source tree.

   $ make distclean
   $ ./configure --prefix /usr
   $ make
   $ make install

This will recompile the target specific parts but will not regenerate
files that are normally in a release tarball.

Of course, you can stay inside Maemo until you make a change that
causes make to run some unavailable tool.  At that point, switch back
to outside of Maemo and run "make dist" there.
