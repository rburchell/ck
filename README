This is ContextKit, a framework for collecting contextual
information from the bowels of the system, cleaning them up
and offering them through a simple API.

The ContextKit consists of:

- libcontextprovider, a convenience library to export 
  contextual properties to the rest of the system.

- libcontextsubscriber, a library implementing 
  the simple API for accessing the contextual information.

- user documentation including a list of standard context properties

By itself, the ContextKit does not implement any of the standard
properties.  You need some real providers or subscriber plugins for
that.  The contextkit-maemo repository has a number of them for Maemo:
