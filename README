This is ContextKit, a framework for collecting contextual
information from the bowels of the system, cleaning them up
and offering them through a simple API.

The ContextKit consists of:

- libcontextprovider, a convenience library to export 
  contextual properties to the rest of the system.

- user documentation including a list of standard context properties

In the future, the following components will be added:

- contextd, daemon for combining and refining contextual information

- libcontextsubscriber, a library implementing 
  the simple API for accessing the contextual information.
