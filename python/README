These directories contain a simple Python binding for the
libcontextprovider library and a test provider tool.  To use them, you
need to ensure that pkg-config works wrt this library.  One way is to
install everything into the appropriate locations, or alternatively, set
PKG_CONFIG_PATH to contain the directories with the .pc files.  The
latter is preferred during development.

Flexiprovider is a Python module/tool for testing Context Framework
clients.  It allows to define properties and provides means to change
their values during runtime.

There are two examples: `simple.py' and `complex.py', which you may use
to get a clue how to write your own provider.  The `context-provide'
script allows you to start up a provider from the command line, without
writing any Python code.

Command line usage of the 'context-provide' tool is documented in
the manpage context-provide.1
