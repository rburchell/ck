These directories contain a simple Python binding for the
libcontextprovider library and a test provider tool.

Flexiprovider is a Python module/tool for testing Context Framework
clients.  It allows to define properties and provides means to change
their values during runtime.

There are two examples: `simple.py' and `complex.py', which you may use
to get a clue how to write your own provider.  The `context-provide'
script allows you to start up a provider from the command line, without
writing any Python code.

The interactive mode supports the following commands on the standard
input (note that this is Python syntax, and it gets eval()ed):

    set(property, value):  sets the given property
    get(property):         prints the value of the property
    reset(property):       resets the property
    add(propertydesc):     adds a new property, see simple.py for
                           examples of propertydesc  
    info():                prints properties and their values
    quit():                stops the whole thing

The provider will stop also if stdin is closed.

You may use `context-rlwrap' as illustrated below to enjoy a more
friendlier readline interface:

  context-rlwrap ./provide.py my.fake.provider
