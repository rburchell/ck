ContextKit - a new Kit on the Block
===================================

(Sorry for the title, my inner child wants to play.)

-------------------------
Context and Conversations


* The stuff that happens around you.

* Shared by the people that you interact with.

* Implicit part of a conversation.

* Ignoring context makes you look absent minded or outright inhuman.

  "Aren't you paying attention?  Why do you keep suggesting to go to
   McD's?  We are on an effing boat in the middle of the ocean."

  [Better example here.]

-------------------------
Context and Computers

* Conversation between Man and Machine.  Also has context.

* Memory: what has the user done recently with the computer?  "Recent
  documents", "Browsing history", "Recently written emails", ...

* Getting additional clues without help from user: time of day, day of
  week, geographical location, sitting still or moving, holding like a
  camera or like a phone, Internet connectivity, ..

* Use that to improve the Man / Machine conversation.

* "Essential Digital Companion".  (Yeah, right)

* Quite fuzzy, experimentation should be easy.


-------------------------
Context and Connections

* Computers facilitate conversations between people

* People want to share their context with their peers.

  * Friendface status updates.

* Computers should help share the context of a conversation between
  people as well.

* (Think video calls: You not only want to hear the guy, you also want
  to see his face and what's happening around him.  Sometimes.)

* Mobile devices make this interesting.  "At his computer" no longer
  means anything.

-------------------------
So?

* Just a small matter of programming.

* DeviceKit, GeoClue, Meta tracker, Telepathy, BlueZ, ConnMan, oFono,
  Sensors, ...

* GNOME, KDE, Maemo, Moblin, 

* C, Glib, Qt, Python, Perl, JavaScript, C#, ...

* Not so small!

-------------------------
ContextKit

* "Global variables for the Desktop"

* Disciplined way of 'setting' those variables

* Concrete list of variables

* Rich type system

* Well integrated into many languages

-------------------------
