Core Context Properties
=======================

This is the list of the core contextual properties of the Maemo
platform.

This document is maintained as part of the +contextkit+ package.
Please report change requests as bugs against the +contextkit+
package.
 
*NOTE:* Most of these properties are unstable and their definition will
change for some time still.  Only the ones explicitly marked as stable
should be used for now.

These properties talk about the display screens of the device.

      <key name="TopEdge" type="STRING">
        <doc>
The edge of the main display screen where the user expects
the top-most UI elements to be.  Possible values are the
strings "top", "bottom", "left", and "right", which refer to
the edges of the screen in its normal orientation as defined
by the graphics hardware.  _(stable)_

Weather
~~~~~~~

The current weather.  (Right now, it's a set of properties, but we
might unify this as a single property with a big dictionary as its
value.  Or not.)  See http://www.ominous-valve.com/wx_codes.txt for
more information about codifying weather conditions.  We should lift
something from there, if just for extra geek points.

Examples are "Cloudy", "Raining", etc.

you can provide an icon for each of them, etc.
