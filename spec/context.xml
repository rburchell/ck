Core Context Properties
=======================

This is the list of the core contextual properties of the Maemo
platform.

This document is maintained as part of the +contextkit+ package.
Please report change requests as bugs against the +contextkit+
package.
 
*NOTE:* Most of these properties are unstable and their definition will
change for some time still.  Only the ones explicitly marked as stable
should be used for now.

Use
---

Information about the current usage context of the device.

Situations are a UI concept similar to Profiles that allows the user
to have different customizations for his/her device and
automatically/explcicitly switch between them.  Typical Situations are
"AtHome", "AtWork", "InMeeting" etc.  Some of them are probably
pre-defined, others can be defined by the user.  Situations might form
a hierarchy: InMeeting includes AtWork.

Not much is known about all this right now.
