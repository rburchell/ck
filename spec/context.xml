Core Context Properties
=======================

This is the list of the core contextual properties of the Maemo
platform.

This document is maintained as part of the +contextkit+ package.
Please report change requests as bugs against the +contextkit+
package.
 
*NOTE:* Most of these properties are unstable and their definition will
change for some time still.  Only the ones explicitly marked as stable
should be used for now.

The edge of the main display screen where the user expects
the top-most UI elements to be.  Possible values are the
strings "top", "bottom", "left", and "right", which refer to

something from there, if just for extra geek points.
+
The value of the weather property is a dictionary with the following
keys.  All keys are optional and additional keys might be present.
+
- *Condition*
+
The current weather condition, as a localized, human readable string.
Examples are "Cloudy", "Raining", etc.
+
- *ConditionCode*
+
The current weather condition, as a symbolic string.  The set of
symbols is to be defined, but it will be fixed and quite small so that
you can provide an icon for each of them, etc.
+
- *Humidity*
+
The relative humidity in percent.
+
- *Temperature*
+
The temperature as a localized string.  This string represents the
temperature in the way preferred by the user.  Most often this means
either degrees Celsius or degrees Fahrenheit, but it could be some
other unit entirely.
+
- *TemperatureK*
+
The temperature in Kelvin.
+
- *ApparentTemperature*
+
The felt temperature as a localized string, analogous to Temperature.
+
- *ApparentTemperatureK*
+
The felt temperature in Kelvin.
+
- *DewPoint*
+
The dew point as a localized string, analogous to Temperature.
+
- *DewPointK*
+
The dew point in Kelvin.
+
- *Pressure*
+
The atmospheric pressure in milli bar.
+
- *Precipitation*
+
