Changes in ContextKit 0.1.7

- Added the "fake provider", which just declares a lot of core
  properties but doesn't implement any of them, relying on the Context
  Commander to give them values.

  This provider is useful to give a pre-view to properties that are
  planned, and hopefully to gather early feedback about them.

- contextd provides hal-based battery properties.
  Couple of bug fixes related to handling properties.
