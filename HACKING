See HACKING in the subsys-context-doc package for general coding guide
lines.

There are some ContextKit specific additions:

- Packaging is done in the "pkg-master" branch, "master" is kept free
  from packaging bits.

  You should merge "master" into "pkg-master" from time to time.
  Never merge "pkg-master" into "master".  If you want to move changes
  from "pkg-master" back to "master", cherry-pick them.

- Package releases are also made from "pkg-master", of course.

  Merge "master" into "pkg-master" and test, fixing any package
  related things.

  Then make a release tag as explained in subsys-context-doc/HACKING.
